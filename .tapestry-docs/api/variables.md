# Variables

Any variables that have been specified in [ui-config.md](../configuration/ui-config.md) are set before the script is executed. For example, the Mastodon connector specifies the following inputs:

```json
{
	"inputs": [
		{
			"name": "site",
			"type": "url",
			"prompt": "Instance",
			"validate_as": "url",
			"placeholder": "https://mastodon.social"
		}
	]
}
```

The current value for the `site` input will be set before the `plugin.js` script is executed. This lets the script adapt to use `mastodon.social`, `mastodon.art`, etc. with code such as this:

```javascript
sendRequest(site + "/api/v1/timelines/home?limit=40")
```

See [ui-config.md](../configuration/ui-config.md) for the specification of each input/variable.

> **Note:** The JavaScript in connectors must conform to the [ECMA-262 specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm). This specification defines the language and its basic [functions](https://262.ecma-international.org/14.0/#sec-function-properties-of-the-global-object) and [objects](https://262.ecma-international.org/14.0/#sec-constructor-properties-of-the-global-object). Additions that support the Document Object Model (DOM) and other browser functions are not available.
